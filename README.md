### Project Overview

This project serves as a platform to familiarize with the concepts of computer graphics and graphical interface development:
- Understanding of the underlying graphics rendering pipeline and Graphics API invocation logic.
- Integration with low-level Windows or Linux operating system API logic.
- Implementation of advanced graphical rendering features such as shaders, textures, materials, and physical properties.
- Development of graphical software functionalities including renderers, windows, input/output processing, and layering effects.

Future developments will include expanding support for DirectX and Vulkan graphics APIs, and potentially exploring development using low-level instruction sets such as SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) CUDA, SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) AVX, or SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions). Other planned implementations involve features like UV mapping, normal mapping, ray tracing using either software-based or hardware-accelerated methods, material ball showcases, and leveraging these to create art, physics, gaming, or animation engines with distinct styles.
